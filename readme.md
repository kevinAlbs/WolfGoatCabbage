Misc
----
- Full bug checking
- Run through JS linter
- Brief code clean (no logic changes)
- Add Google Analytics
- Simplify readme

Extra
-----
- Combine foreground images into one.
- Have goat run away from wolf during end sequence
- Write WebGL filter for ending effects
- Auto shadows (try in PhotoShop)
    + Flip, scale, rotate, erode, recolor.
    + These may all be possible on Phaser sprite. Erode could be done with shader.
- Decision trees for state transition logic
- Consider using Phaser camera bounds for camera follow logic
- Add consts for all magic numbers
- Redo stair animation
- Rest of music should be programmatic (e.g. if farmer walks back into barn, music should stop)
- Add goat noise
- Add JS error checker, to ping me with the stack trace when a Javascript error is caught.
- Report keys "sticking" on MS Edge to Phaser
